The assay conditions for each opioid receptor subtype are described in Table 10 below. The plates were incubated for 8 hours-overnight at room temperature, spun at 1000 rpm to pellet the SPA beads, and radioactivity was measured using the TopCount microplate Scintillation counter. Specific binding at each concentration of test compound was calculated by subtracting the non-specific binding measured in the presence of excess cold ligand. IC50 values were obtained by non-linear regression of specific binding versus concentration curves and Ki values were calculated using Kd values that were experimentally pre-determined for each lot of membrane preparations.",37,BindingDB Database,,2016,299.37,1.5,inactive,0,46,1

Chem. 2012, p 3878), which is incorporated herein in its entirety. Briefly, membrane protein from CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovarian) cells that stably expressed the cloned human u opioid receptor were incubated with 12 different concentrations of the compound set forth herein in the presence of 0.25 nM [3H]DAMGO (see Tiberi et al., Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1988, Vol. 66, p 1368, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety) in a final volume of 1 mL of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 at 25° C. Incubation times of 60 min were used for [3H]DAMGO (see Gulati et al., Life Sci. 1990, Vol. 47, p 159, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Nonspecific binding was measured by inclusion of 10 uM naloxone.

Incubation times of 60 min were used for [3H]DAMGO and [3H]U69,593. Because of a slower association of [3H]naltrindole with the receptor, a 3 h incubation was used with this radioligand. Samples incubated with [3H]naltrindole also contained 10 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Nonspecific binding was measured by inclusion of 10 uM naloxone.

Briefly, membrane protein from CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovarian) cells that stably expressed the cloned human u opioid receptor were incubated with 12 different concentrations of the compound set forth herein in the presence of 0.25 nM [3H]DAMGO (see Tiberi et al., Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1988, Vol. 66, p 1368, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety) in a final volume of 1 mL of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 at 25° C. Incubation times of 60 min were used for [3H]DAMGO (see Gulati et al., Life Sci. 1990, Vol. 47, p 159, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Nonspecific binding was measured by inclusion of 10 uM naloxone.

The assay conditions for each opioid receptor subtype are described in Table 10 below. The plates were incubated for 8 hours-overnight at room temperature, spun at 1000 rpm to pellet the SPA beads, and radioactivity was measured using the TopCount microplate Scintillation counter. Specific binding at each concentration of test compound was calculated by subtracting the non-specific binding measured in the presence of excess cold ligand. IC50 values were obtained by non-linear regression of specific binding versus concentration curves and Ki values were calculated using Kd values that were experimentally pre-determined for each lot of membrane preparations.",37,BindingDB Database,,2016,315.37,1.05,intermediate,1,12,5
